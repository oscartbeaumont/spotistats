This project is a rewritten version of [amaraliou/spotistats](https://github.com/amaraliou/spotistats) with added features including the whole app running in the browser instead of relying on a Go Lang backend.

[Open Icons](https://www.useiconic.com/open) have also been used.

[Netlify](https://netlify.com) provides hosting for the website.
